# lottery-system
This lottery system is based on the Duplicacy of Data in Database and from that random Data is found for a lottery winner.
This system has a multi-entry for the same users in Database which increase the winning chance of user as there are too many same records in it.
This system is not recommended anyhow, this can be improved by applying probability algorithm and chances mechanism also based on that.
But in this chances are double or triple by duplication entry.

This method is not recommended any how at any cost, this is for only tests.
